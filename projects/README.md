# Projects

Put each Spring Boot app in its own folder here.

Suggested naming:
- spring-boot-basics
- rest-api-starter
- todolist-service
- jpa-and-h2
- security-jwt-demo

Each project folder should include:
- README.md (what it does, tech used, how to run)
- Build tool (Maven or Gradle)
- Minimal tests

Example with Maven (from project root):
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Example with Gradle:
```
./gradlew bootRun
```
